            Hello, my name is Simone Medhanie. I enjoy hobbies such as music, sports, traveling. I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2013 with a Bachelor's in Physiology. I worked for 3 years at Fairview Health Services, it was an eye opening a experience. I currently have been working at a private wholesale wine & spirits company for the past year.

            I can't say I have a particularily favorite genre of music. I've listened to and enjoyed older and newer styles, such as Jazz, Classical, Hip-Hop, R&B, Electronic, Funk, Rock, etc. just to name some of my favorite American genres. Music has been a passion since I was young, learning to play piano and trumpet in my early days.

                Another hobby I've recently gotten into is traveling.  The last couple of years have included trips to Los Angeles, Austin (TX), Boston, Nashville, Pittsburgh within the U.S.A.  Within Canada I took a trip to Alberta province, visiting places such as Edmonton, Calgary, and Banff National Park. Lake Louise was definitely one of the highlights of that trip. Recently I've just returned from a trip to Eritrea, the country my family originates from. It's always very fulfilling to visit my extended family. My plan is to visit new places in the near future.
